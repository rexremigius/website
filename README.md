# Portfolio Website

This is one of longest projects of my tech journey.

Basically a cs grad will(probably!) have a portfolio to showcase their work and knowledge.
I too started this project while I was in undergrad and developed a website(hopefully).

So let's name it as `version-0` where I just used all amateur knowledge and used all the possible things to create
the website.I hosted it in a domain which I got cheap or for free (I don't remember). That was super fun.

So for the `version-1`, I totally revamped the portfolio which I got inspired from a friend. I basically sort of cloned and
modified according to my requirements.

This `version-2`, I started to change my resume on the website but who knows, I ended up modifying most features,colours and icons.
