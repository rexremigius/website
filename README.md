# Portfolio Website

This is one of longest projects of my tech journey.

Basically a cs grad will(in the process) have a portfolio to showcase their work and knowledge.
I too started this project while I was in undergrad and developed a website - a basic version.

So let's name it as `version-0` where I just used all amateur knowledge and used all the possible things to create
the website.I hosted it in a domain which I got cheap or for free (I don't remember). That was super fun.

`version-1` - totally revamped the portfolio which I got inspired from a friend.

`version-2` - started to change my resume on the website but who knows, I ended up modifying most features,colours and icons.

`version-2.1` - Added the project section which is due for a long time and I have updated the image, favicon and my resume.
